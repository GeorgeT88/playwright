🔨 Build passes
        ↓
⏳ Vercel deployment confirmed live
        ↓
⚡ repository_dispatch: vercel-deploy

(in parallel: 🔬 Selenium E2E, 🌲 Cypress E2E)
(after all E2E: 🔒 Snyk SCA + 🔎 Semgrep SAST in parallel)
```

Tests can also be triggered manually from **Actions → E2E Tests → Run workflow**, and run on a nightly schedule at **07:00 UTC**.
